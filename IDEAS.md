### AI Powered Link Summarization
1. URL Content Fetching:
  - Add a new command like thoughts save-url <url>
  - Use libraries like node-fetch or axios to download content
  - Support HTML parsing with cheerio to extract main content and remove ads/navigation
2. Content Processing Pipeline:
  ```js
  async function processUrl(url) {
    // 1. Fetch content
    const content = await fetchWebContent(url);

    // 2. Save original content
    const fileName = createFileNameFromUrl(url);
    await saveOriginalContent(fileName, content);

    // 3. Summarize with AI
    const summary = await generateAiSummary(content);

    // 4. Convert to audio (optional)
    const audioPath = await textToSpeech(summary);

    // 5. Create a thought with metadata
    return createThought({
      title: extractTitle(content),
      content: formatSummaryWithMetadata(url, summary),
      originalPath: fileName,
      audioPath
    });
  }
  ```
3. AI Integration Options:
  - Use OpenAI API for GPT
  - Use Anthropic API for Claude
  - Use Google Vertex AI for Gemini
  - Allow user to configure preferred AI in settings
4. Text-to-Speech:
  - Integrate with cloud TTS services like Google Cloud TTS or
 AWS Polly
  - Or use local options like node-gtts for offline
functionality
5. Metadata & Organization:
  - Store metadata (original URL, fetch date, summary type) in
 JSON
  - Add tags for technical topics detected in content
  - Create index for faster searching
6. User Experience Enhancements:
  - Add a queue for batch processing of multiple URLs
  - Provide progress indicators for long-running operations
  - Ensure offline access to all saved content

## Technical Improvements
- Comprehensive test suite
- Better error handling and recovery
- Internationalization support
- Accessibility features
- Detailed documentation with examples
